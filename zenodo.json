    "version": "V6.0.1",
    "description": "<p>Reproducible pipeline and manuscript demonstrating empirical long-range dependence / fractal memory across multiple domains (Bitcoin/crypto volatility, earthquake activity, physiology/HRV, genomics) using DFA-2, bootstrap confidence intervals, and phase-randomized surrogate tests. This package extends LRD v5 (Monte-Carlo validation on synthetic fGn) with real-world empirical evidence.</p><p><strong>v6.0.1 Update:</strong> Added theoretical addenda linking the macroscopic volatility-memory signal to modern market microstructure universality results, including high-precision evidence for the square-root law (SRL) of price impact across all liquid stocks and traders on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (Sato &amp; Kanazawa, <em>Phys. Rev. Lett.</em> <strong>135</strong>, 257401, 2025). The SRL demonstrates that universal power laws emerge in financial markets from microscopic agent aggregation — analogous to critical phenomena in physics. This provides a mechanistic anchor for interpreting cross-market fractal memory.</p><p><strong>Audit Protocol:</strong> DFA-2 scaling estimation + block-bootstrap confidence intervals + phase-randomized surrogate falsification + scale-range sensitivity checks.</p>",
